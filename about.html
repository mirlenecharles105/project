        ABOUT ME
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hello my name is Mirlene Charles and I grew up in areas around Brooklyn, New York. One thing that I could defineatly say is that there are a lot of homeless people around New York and knowing that some of them ended up there though accidental circumstances has inspired me to help them in anyway that I can, especially after having to go through a time where I was homeless also makes me understand the hardships that they go through.
      </p>

        WHY ARE WE HERE?
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are thousands of homeless shelters in the United States and
        very little funding and materials to give out to incoming and residing
        tenants. We take all things from pencils to furniture that we ship out
        to different places around the United States to either be given to
        shelters, salvation armies or through neighborhood give aways to people
        in need. Some of these items are also brought to a few thrift stores
        that sell these donated items and use the money for funding to build
        more shelters.
