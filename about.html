        WHY ARE WE HERE?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hello! There are thousands of homeless shelters in the United States and
        very little funding and materials to give out to incoming and residing
        tenants. We take all things from pencils to furniture that we ship out
        to different places around the United States to either be given to
        shelters, salvation armies or through neighborhood give aways to people
        in need. Some of these items are also brought to a few thrift stores
        that sell these donated items and use the money for funding to build
        more shelters.
